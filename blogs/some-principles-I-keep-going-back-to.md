# Some Principles I Keep Going Back To

Welcome to the very first installation of these blogs! I've been sitting on far too many blog drafts and given some of the things I have been thinking about recently I figured it's about time I started putting these out.

I have never been one for New Year's resolutions - if you need to make change then you don't need to wait for a new year to come around. With that I found it fitting to begin this blog on the 31st before the new year came around ðŸ™ƒ.

As one does when they have too much time on their hands, I was thinking about my life so far and the principles and ideas that I live by or want to live by. Since I'm already doing the heavy lifting of thinking about all of this, I figured that I might as well go ahead and publish this, so here we go.

These are some of the principles that I think have made the biggest difference in my life in no particular order:
### Urgency

I personally think urgency is most important if you want to accelerate the progress you make in life. A strong sense of urgency is hard to cultivate on a daily basis, but it's like a superpower once you get the knack of it. Most people have a habit of taking things too relaxed at times, and that comes back to bite them in more than one way. If you lack any sense of urgency then how are you ever going to make swift progress on anything that you're working on in life? You'll end up taking as long as it takes to get something done, but that would just be the average amount of time - there's nothing wrong with this, but if you're aiming to be more than average then you're going to have to make better progress than the average person. Cultivate and utilize a sense of urgency to get things done quickly!

When I look back in life, I realize that my time in university was so fulfilling and packed with things happening and quick progress being made because of the sense of urgency I had instilled then. Of course it's a lot easier to have a sense of urgency when you're young and don't have too many responsibilities, but that doesn't mean it's not possible to have it when you grow up. An example of this is Elon Musk - you can love or hate him, but one thing you have to give the man is the sense of urgency that he has instilled. Look at the pace in which his companies move and the sense of urgency he has instilled - it's not a deadline set by some board that's moving him, but rather his sense of innate urgency. Doing things like setting up a 100,000 Nvidia H100 GPU cluster in [122 days](https://www.servethehome.com/inside-100000-nvidia-gpu-xai-colossus-cluster-supermicro-helped-build-for-elon-musk/) from start to finish is no simple feat! His urgency on other projects such as making life multi-planetary is something out of this world. Most people limit themselves by what they think has been done already, but if you have an altogether different sense of urgency then you can accomplish a lot more than what's already been done.

I would be lying if I said my sense of urgency with things was the same as a few years ago - this is one of the things that I'm trying to work more on and having a personal deadline on things such as posting this blog before the end of the day is how I try to build up this muscle again. We'll see how that works out :)

### Parkinson's Law

Parkinson's Law famously [states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson's_law) that work expands to fill the time available for its completion. This is the one law in life that I have seen in effect time and time over again. Understanding it and using it to your advantage can do wonders. How many times have you had a project that you said would take 2 weeks to get done but you only start seriously working on it 2 days before it's due and somehow miraculously finish it? People often have a subconscious idea of how long something will take and often times start work only when there is just that much time left to finish the project, filling up the rest of the time with other activities or just barely scratching the surface of the work that needs to be done.

The trick here is to realize that we are all subject to Parkinson's Law, and this combined with procrastination is another superpower that you can utilize in life. The way I have personally been utilizing this is to recognize that if I have a *comfortable* timeline of let's say 4 weeks on a project, and I know that it truly will take 2-3 weeks, then what I communicate is that it will be done in 2 weeks. Granted this puts more pressure on you to get something done, but I've personally found that this is the type of pressure that I thrive under and actually end up enjoying. I fully realize that this differs from person to person and for some people it might actually help to get things done quickly in a timely manner rather than self-creating all this pressure. I can only speak to what works well for me. However, regardless of how things work for you, Parkinson's Law can be applied to one thing or another - consider creating this urgency (yes it ties back in with the sense of urgency that I was talking about earlier) on less critical tasks if you're the type of person who likes doing things promptly.

### Think From Different Angles

How many times have you been stuck on a problem with no solution in sight? Keep yourself sufficiently challenged and this is something you'll run in quite often. I've often fallen in the trap of thinking long and hard about a problem, but in reality I keep going back to a path I was considering earlier and essentially go around in circles. However, taking a step back and  rethinking things often times can lead you to the answer. Some simple examples of this that are good to keep in mind are:
- If you can't solve `X` then look at the inverse of `X`
- Can doing `X` instead of `Y` accomplish the same goal
- Question whether the problem is even the right problem in the first place

I admit that this section is rather incomplete at the moment - after all I am in a rush to get this out soon. I'll come back to refine this some more and add in more concrete examples; I just wanted to get this in the blog so that I have more incentive to come up and update it :)

I'll leave you with one of my favorite quotes from [Tadashi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gc8AdvuHgmM) from Big Hero 6 - **Failure is a part of the process. Look for a new angle.**
P.S.: If you're looking for a movie to watch and haven't watched Big Hero 6 then you need to go watch it ASAP!

### Choose to Be Kind

In a world where you can choose to be anything, choose to be kind. There is so much going on in the world and people are understandably wary of a whole lot at the moment. However, a little kindness and understanding from you can make the day of a person. Life is too short for anger, grudges, or cynicism. There are people who are out there to get you, but I like to believe that this is the minority and most people you interact with have nothing to do with that and are genuinely good people. Help someone out whenever you are in a position to - you never know what impact you will have on them, worst case you don't make any difference, best case you change someone's life.

Kudos to you if you've gotten this far! I'll be updating the website with more blogs now to ensure that there are more of these you have to trudge through :D

And no I didn't use AI to write this blog. Nothing against it, but I would much rather share my raw thoughts and hopefully this way have something on the Internet that models can train on and have a part of me in them in a metaphysical sense!
